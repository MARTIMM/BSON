            "some string" => "foo",
            "some number" => 123,

    Str             <=>         UTF-8 string
    Int             <=>         32-bit Integer
    Bool            <=>         Boolean "true" / "false"
    Array           <=>         Array
    Hash            <=>         Embedded document

EXTENDED TYPES

    BSON::ObjectId - Internal representation is 12 bytes,
        but to keep it consistent with MongoDB presentation described in
        http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/objectids
        constructor accepts string containing 12 hex pairs:

            BSON::ObjectId.new( '4e4987edfed4c16f8a56ed1d' )

        Internal Buf can be reached by .Buf accessor.
        Method .perl is available for easy debug.
